- dual mode Ctxt's
- move convenience fMkCnst, fMkFuncTerm ... terms into Domains, and rename
    all the Factory.Instane.Mk... calls to use those.
- TODOs throught the code base
- clean up old code in Compliler.cs that uses some flavour of AddArgs(...) to newly created convenience functions. E.g.
    - MkZingReturn()
    - MkZingIf()
    - MkIf()
    - MkBinApp()
    - MkNeq
    - MkCastToULONGPTR
    - MkCastFromULONGPTR
    

- Try to convert as many instances as possible of MkZingAssign(Ast<Node>, Ast<node>) to MkZingAssignOrCast(Ast<Node>, Ptype, Ast<node>, PType)
