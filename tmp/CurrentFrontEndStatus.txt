    I haven't implemented this because I don't understand the rationale. Why are impure functions not allowed
    in most contexts? all of these programs can be rewritten in a form that is "obviously" semantically
    identical, but will be accepted by the old compiler.

    e.g. i = i + Action4() + Action5() - Action6();
    becomes: tmp_1 = Action4();
             i = i + tmp1;
             tmp_2 = Action5();
             i = i + tmp_2;
             tmp_3 = Action6();
             i = i - tmp_3;

    e.g. while(impure()) {
             // ...
         }
    becomes: tmp_cond = impure();
             while(tmp_cond) {
                 // ...
                 tmp_cond = impure();
             }

    Checking this in-depth is most likely the halting problem. Is there some reason for this restriction?

[RegressionTests/Feature2Stmts/StaticError/linear2] Expected error, but none were found!

    Is this test correct? It's complaining about impure functions being called in ifs. I guess ownership transfer is impure?

[RegressionTests/Feature2Stmts/StaticError/linear4] Expected error, but none were found!

    I haven't finished implementing linear types. Need to track which function parameters are still owned by the function after calls.

[RegressionTests/Feature2Stmts/StaticError/TransactionType] interface types not implemented.

    Have we settled on semantics for interface types / nominal typing?

[RegressionTests/Integration/Correct/RadioManager] Expected correct, but error was found: [RadioManager.p] parse error: line 14:59 no viable alternative at input 'fun_anon__goto_function(_anon__goto_function_payload:null'

    I'm not allowing null-typed variables. Just leave them out.

[RegressionTests/Zinger/Correct/ZingSealingRR] function annotations not implemented.
[RegressionTests/Zinger/Correct/ZingSealingRTC] function annotations not implemented.

    We're getting rid of Zing, so I'm not bothering with these.
