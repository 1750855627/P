P is a language for asynchronous event-driven programming. P allows the programmer to specify the system as a collection of interacting state machines, which communicate with each other using events. P unifies modeling and programming into one activity for the programmer. Not only can a P program be compiled into executable code, but it can also be validated using systematic testing. P has been used to implement and validate the USB device driver stack that ships with Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Phone. P is also suitable for the design and implementation of networked, embedded, and distributed systems.

Manual

Demos
==========================================================
See [fun demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzLoNbMGhg4) using P to control a quadrocopter and make sense of the MavLink stream, all visualized in a live DGML diagram.
